== Introduction

Welcome to xbib's developer kit for Elasticsearch. This project is for developing Elasticsaerch plugins.
It is derived from the mainline Elasticsearch repository and has the following purposes:

- dismantling the code for building Elasticsearch and Elasticsearch plugins

- handing over a tool for plugin developers to support the complete life-cycle of plugins, using private repositories

- patching and fixing the code to help version updates, dependency managements, custom developments,
especially for plugins outside the mainline development

- learning about the subtleties of Gradle builds

- preparing to make the step from Java 8 to Java 9 and beyond

And last not least, the result should inspire and motivate developers to hack and extend Elasticsearch.

== Analysis

The Elasticsearch code base was always huge and refactoring and modularization efforts were always present.
Elasticsearch uses Gradle as build tool. The code base can be divided into code for building and testing
Elasticsearch and Elasticsearch itself.

There is a Gradle mechanism called
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/organizing_build_logic.html#sec:build_sources[buildSrc]
which allows the inclusion of Gradle plugins into the current
build. Elasticsearch uses this mechanism to roll out several Gradle plugins for build, plugin, doc validation,
and test. The test reuses a customized version of randomizedtesting. And for deploying Elasticsearch to
virtual machines, vagrant gradle plugins are used.

The gradle test tasks are distributed over several gradle plugins. They are useful in situations where
the server code is built, for integration testing, for REST testing. Behind the scenes, the test uses
a test library called the test framework, a large collection of helper classes to execute randomized tests
and perform mocking of Elasticsearch classes. The test framework mimics the bootstrap of the Elasticsearch
server as close as possible and runs under a Java Security Manager, which helps to detect non-behaving
code in the early stage of development.

== New features of this dev kit

This developer kit offers the possibility to introduce new features that are not yet available
in Elasticsearch builds (and probably will never be).

- Java 8 or Java 9 or higher for compilation
- Java 9 based Asciidoclet and Asciidoc gradle plugin
- Monkey patching
